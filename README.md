## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript(ES6)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I didn't learn any major new tricks in this project, but it did unexpectedly make me remember ```css flex-direction:column-reverse``` and ```css flex-direction:row-reverse```

This project also introduced me to a rather unusual layout structure, although it is certainly not the most complex.



### Continued development

I plan to gradually take the Junior level of layout and JavaScript. But I need to study HTML5 semantics in more detail.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind site](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Have amazing docs <3
- [Tailwind cheat sheet](https://tailwindcss.504b.cc/?ref=dailydev) - A very quick and easy-to-use cheat sheet for Tailwind v4.
